# You can cancel your StreamWiz account at any time.

NOTE: This is the only way to cancel your account and end your membership. Signing out of your account or deleting the StreamWiz app doesn't cancel your account.
When membership charges stop

You won't be charged again unless you restart your account. If you cancel with time left in your billing period, you can use StreamWiz until the account cancels automatically at the end of the billing period.

## If you don't see an option to cancel

If you don't see the cancellation option in your account, you'll need to cancel the account with your billing company. On your Account page, you'll see either a link to guide you through the cancellation process with your billing company, or instructions to contact your billing company to cancel.

## Canceling before end of billing period

If you cancel with time left in your billing period, you can use StreamWiz until end of the billing period. To see when your account will close, check your billing details.

## Canceling when account is on hold

If there's a hold on your account, it will close immediately when you cancel.

## Canceling if you have a gift card or promotional balance

After you cancel, you can continue to use StreamWiz for as many months of service that the remaining balance of your StreamWiz gift card or promotion covers. Once your balance runs out, you won't be able to use StreamWiz.

## Pausing membership

If you just want to take a break, you can pause your membership instead of canceling.

This feature is currently only available for customers using a credit or debit card as their primary payment method.

If you pause your membership, you can continue watching StreamWiz until your next billing date. On your next billing date, you will not be charged and your membership will be paused for 1 month. After 1 month, you will be charged your current plan price and can resume watching StreamWiz.

## How to pause membership

* Using a web or mobile browser, go to your Account page and select Cancel Membership.

* Select Pause for 1 Month.

You will not be able to stream or download when your membership is paused, but you can still browse StreamWiz and add to My List.

## How to extend paused membership

A week before your account is automatically unpaused, you will have the option to extend pause for an additional month.

NOTE: Accounts can only be paused for a total of 3 months. If you do not see the option to Extend Pause you may have already paused your account for 3 months, or your primary payment method is no longer a credit or debit card.

* Using a web or mobile browser, go to your Account page.

* Select Extend Pause from the banner that says Ready to watch? at the top of your Account page.

Your membership will be paused for 1 more month.

## How to unpause membership

While your membership is paused, you can unpause or cancel at any time from your Account page. To unpause your membership:

* Using a web or mobile browser, go to your Account page.

* Select Unpause Now from the banner that says Ready to watch? at the top of your Account page.

You will be immediately charged and your billing date will be updated, and you can start watching StreamWiz immediately.

## Rejoining StreamWiz

You can restart your StreamWiz account at any time.

We keep your Viewing Activity for 10 months after your account closes, so it will be available if you restart within that time. Also available for 10 months are:

* Your recommendations

* Ratings

* Account details

* Gameplay history

* Game saves (though for games that don't support cloud saves, the game and game data must still be installed on the device it was played on)

## Preventing others from restarting your account

To make sure that no one in your household can restart StreamWiz without your permission, we recommend that you change your password after canceling your membership, making sure to check the box that says Sign out of all devices. This will change your current password and sign out any devices where your account may still be signed in.
